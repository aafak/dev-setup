# WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)
Allows you to run a Linux distribution alongside your Windows system without needing a separate virtual machine or dual boot.
Hereâ€™s how you can install and use WSL on Windows:

# Install WSL:  Open powershell and type following command
```
PS C:\Users\aafakmoh>  wsl --install
```
# Start WSL:
```
PS C:\Users\aafakmoh> wsl
Provisioning the new WSL instance Ubuntu
This might take a while...
Create a default Unix user account: aafak
New password: test
Retype new password: test
passwd: password updated successfully
To run a command as administrator (user "root"), use "sudo <command>".
See "man sudo_root" for details.

# WSL Dynamically Adjusting Memory Usage
By default, WSL2 does not have a fixed memory allocation. Instead, it dynamically adjusts its memory usage based on the workload and available system resources.
This means: If your WSL2 instance needs more RAM, it will request it from Windows. If WSL2 no longer needs memory, it will gradually release it back to Windows.

There's no predefined limit on how much memory WSL2 can use unless manually restricted. What Happens When You Restrict Memory Using .wslconfig?
When you set a memory limit in .wslconfig, WSL2 will be forced to stay within that limit, preventing it from consuming all available RAM.

[wsl2]
memory=4GB
WSL2 can use up to 4GB, but not more. Even if more RAM is available in Windows, WSL2 will not exceed 4GB. This prevents WSL2 from competing with other Windows applications for memory.

# Why Restrict Memory in WSL2?
 - Prevent Windows from Slowing Down
 - If WSL2 consumes too much memory, Windows applications might struggle.
 - Control Performance for Development
 - If you run multiple services in WSL2, setting a memory cap prevents one process from hogging all resources.
 - Better Stability in Heavy Workloads
 - Limiting memory can help prevent system crashes or unresponsiveness.
